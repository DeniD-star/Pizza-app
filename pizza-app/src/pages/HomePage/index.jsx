            <p>
              When you want to make a really good pizza, the choice can only
              fall on high quality ingredients. The reason? Well, it's simple:
              it is precisely the ingredients that form the main framework of
              the pizza and give it that exquisite flavor that distinguishes it
              from any pizza.

                A Neapolitan pizza with a pronounced and faithful to the cornice
                tradition: it is Francesco Di Rosa's pizza. The curiosity for the
                baking has always been in the blood of Francesco, who has
                abandoned his previous job to devote himself to
                training as a pizza chef. After various experiences around
                Italy, six years ago Francesco decided to open his own
                activity in Sicignano degli Alburni, where he brought and made
                know the Neapolitan pizza. That's where the
                31 years old Francesco takes the ingredients for his pizza:
                local and quality ingredients. With type 0 flour and
                indirect doughs, simple ingredients and a lot of passion,
                Francesco tries to bring all the flavors of his to customers
                mountain village, reinventing itself every day. A pizza yes
                faithful to tradition, but without neglecting innovation.

               Verdevasinicola was born from a dream and from the determination of
                Milena Natale, pizza chef from Caserta who wants to tell the story
                tradition of "pizza a libretto" around Italy with a
                Traveling ape car. Over the years the concept has evolved and has
                led to the opening of stable premises. Today Verdevasinicola yes
                is established at the gates of Cilento. The heart of Verdevasinicola
                the pizza of excellence remains: it is impossible not to try the dough
                special of Milena Natale and savor the scent of
                tradition that meets modernity, all rigorously
                accompanied by the smell of fresh basil. Milena offers a
                refined but traditional cuisine and a pizza closer and closer
                to the flavors of the territory. From the ingredients to the style of
                local, every detail is sought in quality and cared for
                the smallest details. It is amazing to see the energy that Milena,
                mother of two girls, female pizza maker, "female" - like her yes
                describes on his website online - he takes in carrying every day
                passion in the dishes and in the dining room.
